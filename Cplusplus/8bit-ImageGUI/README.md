Create a graphical user interface that allows the user to take the following actions:
1. Load/display an 8-bit bitmap original image.
2. Load/display an 8-bit bitmap overlay image.
3. Generate and display an output image by overlaying the overlay image over the original
image.
4. Generate and display and output image from the original image by histogram-equalizing it.
5. Adjust image brightness with a slider (this slider sets a factor by which the brightness is
multiplied)
6. Adjust image contrast with a slider (this slider configures a transfer function that either
compresses the brightness histogram for lower contrast or stretches it for higher contrast).
7. Save the output image as an 8-bit bitmap file.
