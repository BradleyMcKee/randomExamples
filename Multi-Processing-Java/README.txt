 HOW TO RUN-------------------


/PRODCONS/SRC$ javac Main.java

/PRODCONS/SRC$ java Main


I have the output of the statistics printing to terminal.
In results.txt I have the entries that were created.
I created separate threads for consumer, producer and one that controls.
if you want to change the number of p or c, open Main.java and make the changes accordingly because I didn't have time to finish coding it to take those as inputs from keyboard (could've done with more time). I need to utilize semaphore a little better, and it keeps throwing it out of bounds i have no idea why though
